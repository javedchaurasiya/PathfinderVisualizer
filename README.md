# PathfinderVisualizer

This is a Pathfinder/Graph-Traversal visualizer.</br>
I have currently added three algorithms for the </br>
same ( BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorith ) but plan </br>
to add some more namely A* Search Algorithm,</br>
Bidirectional-BFS etc.

# What I have used for this Project

1.HTML </br>
2.CSS mostly CSS-Grids </br>
3.Pure JavaScript </br>
</br>
</br>
Forgive my HTML and CSS ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
</br></br>
I have also included a Maze-Generation-algorithm </br>
coded in C++,It is based on Recursion/DFS/Backtracking.

# INFO

1.The unvisted/empty cells on the grid represent</br>
   a cost of 1 i.e from any of its adjacent cell if you</br>
   wish to move onto that cell your total cost becomes</br>
   => Prev. Cost + 1 ;
   </br>
   </br>
2.The Weight cells on the grid represent a cost</br>
   of 5 i.e from any of its adjacent cell if you wish </br>
   to move onto that cell your total cost becomes</br>
   => Prev. Cost + 5 ;
